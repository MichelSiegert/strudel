## Collection of me playing around with strudel

I have recently been trying to get back into making music with strudel and so I created this project so that I could save them for myself. 
https://strudel.cc/ is where you can use the code snippets.
Strudel itself is a sound engine based on tidal, but setting up tidal is a big hassel and its also written in haskell, which is a beautiful language for about as long as you try to do nothing with it.
